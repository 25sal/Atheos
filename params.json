The system is still early in development, and while it has been proven extremely stable please be sure to backup regularly if you use it in any production work.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nInstallation of Codiad requires uploading the files and making several directories and a config file writeable. There is no database and no other server components are required. PHP 5.3 or above is recommended, however, the system will work with any version of PHP over v.5.\r\n\r\nFor more information please [read the installation instructions](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Codiad/wiki/Installation) on the Wiki.\r\n\r\n## Getting More Advanced\r\n\r\nCodiad is a very complete package, however, it was designed to allow developers to easily expand upon the base platform.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to develop components or custom functionality please [check out the Wiki](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Codiad/wiki) for information about the architecture and API.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n_Project developed by [Kent Safranski](http://www.fluidbyte.net) with support from [Tictonix](http://www.tictonix.com)_","name":"Codiad","google":"UA-34692757-1"}
